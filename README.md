The primary objective of our analysis is to comprehend passenger booking behavior and preferences during air travel. We conduct an extensive ETL process to extract data from a CSV file, transform it by performing operations like dropping irrelevant columns, mapping categorical values to numerical equivalents, and truncating strings, and then load it into our SQL database in a new table, 'PassengerBooking', further divided into 'Passenger', 'Flight', 'Booking' tables.

Post-ETL, we analyze booking completions, booking origins, flight hour distribution by class, and in-flight meals preference. The purpose of the analysis is to provide insights that can enhance booking completion rates, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline operational efficiency.
